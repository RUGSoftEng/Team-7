Google chromecast game development.

__This project is built under Unity 5.1__ (the latest supported version for chromecast). You can download the ubuntu version
[here](http://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/unity-editor-5.1.0f3+2015091501_amd64.deb).
Other (less supported) linux distros can try [this one](http://download.unity3d.com/download_unity/unity-editor-installer-5.1.0f3+2015091501.sh).
Windows has an installer [here](https://unity3d.com/unity/whats-new/unity-5.1.4).

__Contributers:__ It is strongly reccomended that you make a copy of this project, or (even better) make a branch.
Final commits can then be safely merged with the master, _keeping this
version stable and uncorrupted for all to use_.

__New to unity?__
Try [this tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial) first.
Then to learn 2D specifics, I suggest taking a peep at [these vids](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation).
It should not take you that long, it's just a tool. Try to have some fun with it!

Please tell me if any of these links die, I'll perform CPR.
