__New to unity?__
Try [this tutorial](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/projects/roll-ball-tutorial) first.
Then to learn 2D specifics, I suggest taking a peep at [these vids](https://unity3d.com/learn/tutorials/topics/2d-game-creation).
It should not take you that long, it's just a tool. Try to have some fun with it!

Please tell me if any of these links die, I'll perform CPR.
